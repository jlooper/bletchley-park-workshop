## Instructor materials

This content can be run as either a short [workshop](./workshop.md), where you will lead students in building a web app, or a [hackathon](./hackathon.md) *describe the content here*

Feel free to fork this repo and edit the instructions for your purpose.

## Leading a hackathon *edit for your purposes*

On-the-spot short hackathons are more spontaneous, and don't require pre-work to build teams. If you want to run a micro-hack or spontaneous hackathon, use Teams Live to schedule and invite folks to your event. Consider partnering with other trainers to allow for breakout rooms on Teams if attendees need help or mentoring. At the time of the event, your schedule could be the following:

| Time       |                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10 minutes | Introduction and welcome, explain the hack goals                                                        |
| 30 minutes | Play the video presentation                                                                             |
| 20 minutes | Code walk-through                                                                                       |
| 45 minutes | Live Hacking begins! Monitor the chat for opportunities to answer question and mentor                   |
| 15 minutes | Encourage participants to share their work on Teams Live by posting the links of what they have shared. |
|            |

## Teaching a workshop

You can teach a code-along workshop using these materials. Student instructions are [here](./workshop.md). You could conduct this workshop via Teams or as a Teams Live event. It's a good idea to include mentors who can watch the chat and help attendees if they get stuck. 

Before the workshop, send out an email outlining your schedule and encouraging pre-installation of the following:

*make a list of pre-requisite installations*

Previewing the app: *give instructions on how to preview the final project* 

Getting started: to build the app from scratch, instruct users on prerequisites and point your users to the participant instructions and code alongside them.
   
You can follow this schedule during your event:

| Time       |                                                                                                            |
